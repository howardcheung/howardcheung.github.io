I am working on multiple research projects and some open-source projects for everybody to enjoy. Check them out below!

## Open-source softwares and projects

### Current
#### [Data Preprocessing Helper](https://howardcheung.github.io/data-preprocessing-helper/)
I made this Windows 64-bit application to help building engineers to preprocess their building management system (BMS) data for easier analysis in spreadsheet format. Issues it solves includes filling in gaps of data and aligning the recording time of the data. It also works for other types of time-series data as well. Check the website and the repository for more information over [here](https://howardcheung.github.io/data-preprocessing-helper/).

### Previous
#### [Openstudio fault models](https://github.com/nrel/openstudio-fault-models)
I worked on this project previously to create models of faults (e.g. deviation from design) of building equipment for building simulation in [OpenStudio](https://www.openstudio.net/). You can download the OpenStudio and EnergyPlus measure scripts in the repository to model the impact of different types of building equipment faults on building thermal performance and energy consumption. You can also read the details of the models I made at [Development of Fault Models for Hybrid Fault Detection and Diagnostics Algorithm](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65030.pdf).

## Research projects

### Current
#### Building energy assessment
I am working on examining the energy-saving potentials and faults in various building systems to reduce their energy consumption. Issues like chiller and pump sequencing, overcooling, low-$\Delta$T syndromes are being examined, and their control systems are being configured to reduce the unnecessary energy consumption caused by these issues.

#### Data center energy management solution
I am working on energy management solutions such as fault detection and diagnostics and control designs for data centers to reduce their cooling system energy consumption. The project has just started and if you're interested in collaboration, feel free to contact me at <howard.at@gmail.com>!

#### Uncertainty calculation for thermal system applications
I have spent quite some time to work on calculation of uncertainties due to various factors such as regression data measurement uncertainties, choice of regression data, model structure, etc. for thermal system models. There are some publications about the research for compressor models, and the project is still on-going for other thermal applications. If you want to know more, you can look it up at my publication list or contact me directly at <howard.at@gmail.com>!

### Previous
I am still organizing this section and haven't listed everything yet. In the meantime, check out [my publication list](../publications) for more information!
