Writing is needed in research. We write proposals to compete for grants. We write notebooks to organize our ideas. We write papers to publish in journals. But we are no professional writers. We are trained to review literature. We are trained to reason logically. We are trained to plan and exexute experiments. We are trained to do mathematics and run computer simulations. Writing is just not one of our core skills. So what can we do to improve our writing? Here are some tools that I use to improve my writing.

# Dictionaries and thesaruses

A dictionary is important when you want to check the exact meaning of a word and to ensure that you're not writing nonsense. They also provide a few example sentences for you to understand how the words should be used.

A thesarus is important to find words with identical or opposite meaning (synonym and antonym). If you have used a word for too many times and a paragraph has become too boring to read, you may want to use a thesarus to look up its synonym to replace it. Likewise, if you want to find a word which meaning is opposite to another word, you can do so with a thesarus. While dictionaries anre thesaruses used to be separate books, online websites at present combine the two together pretty well, and you don't need to keep looking up words in two books for the correct usage of a word!

## British English

[Oxford Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/) provides the meaning of a lot of words in British English. While its function is similar to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, you may need to switch between the two dictionaries depending on whom you are writing to.

## American English

[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) provides the meaning of a lot of words in details. It also provides good example sentences for you to understand how the word should be used.

[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) provides simple defintions of some words. It does not have so many example sentenes as the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, but some entries contains usage notes that help you to distinguish words with very similar meaning. See an example on the difference between *besides* and *beside* [here](https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=besides).

# Collocation

Word combinations are also important in writing. If you use two words together incorrectly, nobody would know what you're saying. But how can one know if two words can be together?

[English Language & Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/) and [English Language Learners Stack Exchange](https://ell.stackexchange.com/) are two good websites from Stack Exchange which provides a lot of Q&As for collocations. One of their advantage is that you don't need to go to their websites to look for their content. If you google the pharase under question, they related Q&A will pop up in your search results. However, the quality of the answers is heavily dependent on the replies, and sometimes they may even generate more questions than answers.

[JustTheWord](http://www.just-the-word.com) finds out appopriate combinations of words by conducting analysis and statistics over a corpus called [British National Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Corpus). AIf you enter a word to the website, it summarizes the common combinations of the word used in various types of documents. How is it used as an object with other words? How about its uses with other words as a verb? It's easy to use and can even provide more example sentences of a word than a dictionary. However, if you enter more than one word in your search query, it fails.

[Linggle](http://www.linggle.com/) also works similarly as JustTheWord with more powerful function to specify whether you need nouns, verbs or other parts of speech after the word in question. It also allows you to specify wildcards in your search queries. However, it is not open about what corpus is being used for the results. It also does not provide a lot of good example sentences like JustTheWord. So you should use it with a dictionary to ensure that it's results are correct.
