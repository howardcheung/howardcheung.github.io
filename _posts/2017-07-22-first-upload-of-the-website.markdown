This is my real website that can be customized by myself, and I am really excited about it. Previously, I could only enter my profiles at Xanga (I know it's old), bepress, LinkedIn, ResearchGate, etc. as my website. It's a little bit frustrating because I cannot upload stuffs or links as I want (e.g. open-source repositories, publication preprints). With this website, I can customize it and put whatever I like such as blog posts, leisure-time projects, etc.

As you can see, there are still lots to work on in this website. This includes

* Images (I know how boring it is to build a text-only website. I will work on it).
* Theme (It's always good to try different themes, especially when I am using Jekyll to build this site, right?)
* Publication preprints (Need to check the journal embargo periods so that I won't step into any copyright grey areas)
* Research experience profile
* Interesting project results
* Interaction interface
* Chinese version of the website

To be honest, I consider this as my work to-be-done list and I don't expect anyone reading this other than myself. If you are really reading it and you have a lot of time to kill, please send me an email and say how you end up here =P
