It's been long since I updated the blog. It's hard to find time to update the blog when you were visiting castles in the UK..... I mean attending the Applied Energy conference in Cardiff, UK. Maybe I'll find some time to talk about the conference (and other travels) later.

I think the old interface contains too many items at the first glance so I split the settings into Basic and Advanced to create a UI like this:

This should make it easier for beginners to use it to organize poorly formatted data properly for easier analysis in spreadsheets.

You can find the details of the project at [Data Preprocessing Helper](https://howardcheung.github.io/data-preprocessing-helper/) and download the new release [here](https://github.com/howardcheung/data-preprocessing-helper/releases/tag/v0.3.6).
