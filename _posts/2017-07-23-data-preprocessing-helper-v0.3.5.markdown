I have released a new version of Data Preprocessing Helper to assist the analysis of Building Management System (BMS) data!

![](https://github.com/howardcheung/data-preprocessing-helper/raw/master/doc/ui.png "Graphical User Interface")

With this release, you can preprocess you data nicely with

* Auto-detect the format of input time string in your first column. No more messing around with the time string!
* Both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications are now available!

In this case, you can convert poorly aligned data from

to something as nice as

for your spreadsheet analysis with a simple GUI

You can find the details of the project at [Data Preprocessing Helper](https://howardcheung.github.io/data-preprocessing-helper/) and download the new release [here](https://github.com/howardcheung/data-preprocessing-helper/releases). Be sure to check it out!
