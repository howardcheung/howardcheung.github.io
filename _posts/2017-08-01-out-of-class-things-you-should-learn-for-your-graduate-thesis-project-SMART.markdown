When you begin your work, do you have someone to tell you what to do? Probably not, right? You have lots of deadlines, requests from clients, orders from your boss(es), opinions from teammates, tasks from your colleagues, etc. But nobody tells you what to do first and what to do next. All you know is that if you cannot finish a number of them, you're going to be in trouble or even get fired. This is especially true for researchers whose project and task spans more than a week. If you miss any of those tasks, it will be too late by the time you realize the mistake. So, what can you do about it?
