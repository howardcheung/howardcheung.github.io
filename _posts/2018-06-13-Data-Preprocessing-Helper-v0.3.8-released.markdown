It seems that errorneous data may contain entries with same time stamps, and my previous version can't handle that. It's fine. The bug is fixed now, and the newest version of the software is now v0.3.8.

If your work involves scenarios similar to this case, please use the newest version to process your data again.

You can find the details of the project at [Data Preprocessing Helper](https://howardcheung.github.io/data-preprocessing-helper/) and download the new release [here](https://github.com/howardcheung/data-preprocessing-helper/releases/tag/v0.3.8).
